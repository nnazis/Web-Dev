    <h1>The Thing is</h1>
    <p>to love life, to love it even <br>
when you have no stomach for it <br>
and everything you’ve held dear <br>
crumbles like burnt paper in your hands, <br>
your throat filled with the silt of it. <br>
When grief sits with you, its tropical heat <br>
thickening the air, heavy as water <br>
more fit for gills than lungs; <br>
when grief weights you down like your own flesh <br>
only more of it, an obesity of grief, <br>
you think, How can a body withstand this? <br>
Then you hold life like a face <br>
between your palms, a plain face, <br>
no charming smile, no violet eyes, <br>
and you say, yes, I will take you <br>
I will love you, again</p>
    </body>
