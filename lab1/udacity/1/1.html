<p>When grief sits with you, its tropical heat
thickening the air, heavy as water
more fit for gills than lungs;</p>
<span>to love life, to love it even
when you have no stomach for it and everything you’ve held dear.</span>
<span>crumbles like burnt paper in your hands,your throat filled with the silt of it.</span>
